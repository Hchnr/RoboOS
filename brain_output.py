Given the robot\'s `navigate_to_target` capability, this is a feasible single-step task.\n2. **Grasp Apple from Kitchen Table (Sub-task 2)**: Once at the kitchen table, the robot needs to pick up the apple. Using the `grasp_object` function, this is another single-step task.\n3. **Navigate to Serving Table (Sub-task 3)**: After picking up the apple, the robot needs to move to the serving table. Again, this is a single-step task using the `navigate_to_target` function.\n4. **Place Apple on Serving Table (Sub-task 4)**: At the serving table, the robot places the apple. This is a single-step task using the `place_to_affordance` function.\n5. **Navigate Back to Kitchen Table (Sub-tasks 5 and 7)**: The robot needs to return to the kitchen table twice. Both these tasks are single-step tasks using the `navigate_to_target` function.\n6. **Grasp Bowl from Serving Table (Sub-task 6)**: Finally, the robot picks up the bowl from the serving table. This is a single-step task using the `grasp_object` function.\n\nEach sub-task is designed to be complex enough to involve multiple steps but not so complex that it requires coordination between multiple robots. The robot\'s tools (`navigate_to_target`, `grasp_object`, and `place_to_affordance`) are sufficient to perform each sub-task independently.',
